<P>Matlab is a language for technical-mathematical computing. The language has a
huge number of syntactic constructs. Some are known from other languages like
C, Fortran and so on, some are Matlab-specific. Due to the huge number of
syntactic constructs implemented in Matlab and their sometimes slightly
different meaning in a specific context, not all language features
are completely implemented in ADiMat. That is, the syntactic constructs are
parsed, but their meaning is only partially or not at all known to ADiMat.
A warning message is printed, if ADiMat encounters an unknown construct, but
the differentiation process continues. If a warning about unknown
language features is printed, the differentiated code has to be checked. Below
is a list of the most commonly used Matlab features that are supported,
partially supported or not supported at all.
The lists below is subject to change as development of ADiMat continues. These
lists are set up at October 2011.</P>
<P>If you encounter a language construct or a builtin function that is
not treated correctly by ADiMat or not implemented at all, please tell
the author about it. This will help us to enhance and maintain
ADiMat. Especially Matlab builtin functions may be missing their
derivative information in our database.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc3.1">Supported Matlab features</A>
</H2>

<P>These syntactic constructs are supported completely. Their differentiation is
tested. If you encounter any problems, tell the author immediately.
<UL>
<LI> all mathematical operators like (+, -, *, /, \ ...)</LI>
<LI> real and complex values</LI>
<LI> vectors, matrices, cell arrays, structures and dynamic structures</LI>
<LI> all flow control structures</LI>
<LI> multiple functions per project</LI>
<LI> local functions and nested functions</LI>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc3.2">Partially supported Matlab features</A>
</H2>

<P>Some features of Matlab are parsed by ADiMat, but they may not be treated
correctly. That is, the differentiated code may be incorrect. Whenever such
a feature is found, ADiMat issues a warning and continues its task. The
features which are not completely implemented are listed below:
<UL>
<LI> java function calls (will be treated as structures)</LI>
<LI> load- and save-command</LI>
<LI> call of shell-commands (!-operator)</LI>
<LI> varargin- and varargout-constructs</LI>
<LI> function handles, if they are declared via the 
<A HREF="adimat-10.html#FUNCTION_HANDLE">FUNCTION_HANDLE</A> directive</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc3.3">Matlab features not supported at all</A>
</H2>


<P>Some Matlab features are not supported at all. These are listed below:
<UL>
<LI> classes</LI>
<LI> private functions (functions that reside in a private directory of the
current path).</LI>
<LI> Matlab extension, or MEX functions, written in C/C++ or
Fortran. If you have MEX-functions in your project, contact the
author. Research was done to support these, too.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc3.4">Limitations of the reverse mode (admDiffRev) (in addition to the above)</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>On-the-fly creation or enlargement of array and structs is
supported. For example x(4) = 17, where x did not exist
before. However creation or enlargement is only allowed on the last
subscripting level. For example, in x(4).abc.def = 17 the
subexpression x(4).abc must be valid to read before the assignment,
and in x(4).abc.def(2) = 17 the subexpression x(4).abc.def must be
valid to read.</LI>
<LI>Enlargement of arrays is only supported if all the fields
assigned to are created. E.g. x(4) = 17; x(2:6) = 12; is not allowed
as the second assignment assigns to 2:4, which already exists, but
also creates 5:6.</LI>
<LI>Variables first assigned to in a loop pose a certain problem.
ADiMat inserts initialiation with 0 at the beginning of the
function. This fails if the first assignment is of more than one
dimension. ADiMat may be able to detect this and create better
initializations in the future. If the variable is recognized to have
type struct, then the initialization is with struct instead of 0. This
may create new problems as the next assignment may fail as the two
structs have different components, while it does not fail when the
variable is still unassigned. As a workaround, initialize your
variables at the top of your functions (unconditional initialization).</LI>
<LI><B>return</B> is not supported, more precisely, it is currently
ignored when inside a branch. An early return on the main statement
level is allowed. Hence, there is no problem when the return is inside
a branch and is not actually run through, as in the following example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
if mistake
  fprintf(2, 'error: a mistake occured')
  return
end
more code
return
unused code
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This should work if the mistake does not happen. The second return is
used to basically comment out the unused code, and this is supported.</LI>
<LI><B>try</B> and <B>catch</B> are not supported</LI>
<LI>Missing builtin functions declared with the BMFUNC directive are
not differentiated, the RM has its own extension mechanism</LI>
<LI>Numeric indices must not have repeated entries. Both <CODE>x =
y([1 1 2 2])</CODE> and <CODE>x([1 1 2 2]) = y</CODE> are nto supported.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc3.5">Limitations of the classless vector mode (admDiffVFor)</A>
</H2>

<P>The limitations listed here are in addition to the limitations of
ADiMat in general.
<UL>
<LI>
<P>Index operations are by default wrapped in calls to the runtime
functions
<CODE>adimat_opdiff_subsref</CODE>
and <CODE>adimat_opdiff_subsasgn</CODE>. These are rather slow. However,
your code may not actually need these runtime functions. They can be
avoided if you set the following transformation options:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
opts.paramaters.useSubsref = 0
opts.paramaters.useSubsasgn = 0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you do this, the indexing into matrices in your code should be
"correct". That means, that the indices used should reflect the shape
of the resulting value:
<UL>
<LI>components of a row vector s should always be indexed into with
either s(1,ind) or s(:,ind)</LI>
</UL>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>Missing builtin functions declared with the BMFUNC directive are not differentiated</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.6">3.6</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc3.6">Limitations of admDiffFor and admDiffRev</A>
</H2>

<P>The 
<A HREF="adimat-4.html#hlui">high-level user interface</A> functions
admDiffFor and admDiffRev have some limitations, which are listed
here. In some cases there are workarounds, but in some other cases you
may have to use the lower level interface, using the recipes explained
in other sections of this manual.
<UL>
<LI>Function handles are partially supported by ADiMat using
the 
<A HREF="adimat-10.html#FUNCTION_HANDLE">FUNCTION_HANDLE</A> directive, but
support for this has not yet been added to the high-level interface.</LI>
