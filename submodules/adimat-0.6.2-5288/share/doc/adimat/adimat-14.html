<P>Builtin-declarations are 'equations' that define a function of Matlab and its
differentiated function or code. Matlab has a set of builtin-,
intrinsic- or toolbox-supplied-functions (for simplicity these functions are
called toolbox-functions from now on), that are not defined in a .m-file
(allthough one may exists!), but are known to the MatLab-executable. The code of
these functions can not be differentiated by ADiMat, because the .m-file of
these functions only contains a description (some comments) and no code.
Furthermore the differentiation of such a function is done by replacing the
function call using a different function (e.g. The derivative of sin(x)
is cos(x)). Another way had to be choosen to specify the derivative of
these functions: builtin-declarations.</P>
<P>A builtin-declaration specifies the signature of a function, (e.g. the
signature of the sinus is: $$=sin($1)) and the
corresponding actions of ADiMat when differentiating this function. Possible
actions are '<CODE>DIFFTO</CODE>' (may also be written '<CODE>DIFFSTO</CODE>'),
'<CODE>REPLACE</CODE>' (also '<CODE>REPL</CODE>'), '<CODE>IGNORE</CODE>', '<CODE>NODIFF</CODE>',
'<CODE>ERROR</CODE>', '<CODE>WARNING</CODE>', and '<CODE>SPECIAL</CODE>' (also
'<CODE>SPEC</CODE>'). With these actions it is possible to specify the
differentiated code of a function, replace a function call to compute its
original result and derivative, ignore the function when differentiating
it, do not differentiate this function, print an error-message, add a warning
message where ever the specified function occurs, and do something not yet known
to ADiMat in the current version, respectively. The last modifier
is reserved for extensions in future versions of ADiMat. The following
sections briefly discuss the structure of the file where the
builtin-declarations are specified in and the builtin-declarations
themselves.</P>
<P>Starting with version 0.5 ADiMat no longer uses the .amb-files directly, but
uses a preprocessed form of the builtin-declarations stored in an SQL-database.
Nevertheless the .amb-files are used to build the database using the tool
<A HREF="#dbbuild">dbbuild</A>. The builtin-declarations known to ADiMat
prior to version 0.5 may also be used as directives in Matlab-files to
differentiate (see 
<A HREF="adimat-10.html#directivebuiltindeclaration">directivebuiltindeclaration</A>
).</P>
<H2><A NAME="amb-files"></A> <A NAME="ss14.1">14.1</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc14.1">.amb-files</A>
</H2>

<P>The postfix '.amb' is the short form of
<B>A</B>Di<B>M</B>at<B>B</B>uiltins. A
.amb-file may contain zero (does not really make sense) or more
builtin-declarations. It also may contain empty lines and comments,
which will be ignored. A comment starts with a '%' and runs to the end
of the line. !!! A comment starting with '%ADiMat' is not ignored,
it is treated as a regular builtin-declaration and has to conform to the
specification of a builtin-declaration. Whenever an error is encountred while
parsing a .amb-file a message displayed and the line is ignored. The parsing
of the file continues at the next line.
The 
<A HREF="#dbbuild">dbbuild tool</A>'s default is to look for the
.amb-file 'ADiMat.amb' in the following path (in this order):
<UL>
<LI>${ADIMAT_HOME}/share/adimat (on Unix)</LI>
<LI>${ADIMAT_HOME}/builtins (on Windows)</LI>
<LI>${HOME}/.adimat (the directory .adimat in the users home
directory)</LI>
<LI>. (the current directory)</LI>
</UL>

The lookup-process terminates as soon as the file is found. The user may
specify his own .amb-path-list by using the command line option 
<A HREF="#dbbuildbuiltinspath">--builtinpath=&lt;BUILTINFILELIST&gt;</A> or the
environment-variable 
<A HREF="adimat-11.html#BUILTINSPATH">ADIMAT_BUILTINSPATH</A>. Use
of environment-variables within the .amb-path-list is permitted. ADiMat will
try to fetch the values from the machine-environment and replace the
variable-names in the path-list with their values (if not allready done by the
shell). If a directory is not found or is unreadable, a message is printed
and the according directory is skipped.
One special .amb-file exists. It defines the symbols used within the
Matlab-class of ADiMat. The file is named 'ADiMat_internal.amb'. Its content
is essential for a correct differentiation of most Matlab-files. In the
current implementation the file is included by 'ADiMat.amb'.</P>

</H2>

<P>This section describes the syntax and keywords of builtin-declarations. First
some explanations of the language used to define the syntax: Keywords and
literals are written in single quotes and have to appear in the declaration
without the quotes. Variable- and function-names are written: &lt;name&gt; and
have to conform with the MatLab-identifier rules. They may begin with a
character (upper- and lower-case) or an underscore followed by one or more
(upper- or lower-case) characters, underscores and numbers in any order.
Unquoted lowercase words represent rules that will be expanded to their
contents.
&lt;NUM&gt; represents a non-fractional number starting with one.</P>

<P>A function signature specifies the name of the function and the number of its
return arguments and parameters. Optionally a type may be specified with each
return argument and parameter.
A function name may be followed by an optional parameterlist. This list may be
non-existent, that is no parentheses are specified at all, an empty list may
be specified, that is empty parentheses are following the function name, or
parameters are specified between the parentheses. A parameter is specified
using a '$'-sign followed by a non-fractional number. The counting
starts with one and has to be specified. A function using one parameter has to
specify the parameter '$1'. If more than one parameter is used, the
parameters have to be numbered consecutively. The symbol '&lt;NUM&gt;' in the
syntax diagram below denotes the highest number of the parameters. The symbol
'$#' denotes a variable number of arguments. Any number of
arguments may be assigned to this symbol including zero. The last two lines of
the syntax diagram below denote the way of specifying a number of arguments
that have to be specified for this particular function.

ADiMat compares the signature specified by these parameter list with the list
of arguments the function is called in the program to differentiate with. If
the numbers do not match, a warning is issued.
The return arguments are specified similiar. If only one single return
argument is to be specified, this may be done using the
'$$'-expression which is an abbreviation for
'[$$1]'. If more than one return argument is to be
specified, they have to be written in square brackets. The
'$$#'-expression has to be specified in square bracktes,
even if it is the only return argument. The '$$#'-expression
denotes that a function returns more than one result similiar to the
'$#'-expression in the parameter list.</P>

<P>These identifiers represent simple types. 'real' and 'complex' type a
parameter as a scaler real or complex number. The type 'scalar' is an alias
for 'complex', because every real number also is a complex number. 'scalar'
was introduced to let the user express his intention to specify one single
number more precisely.
'matrix' types a real or complex matrix. There is no distinction between these
two kinds, not yet.
'generic' types everything that is not explicitly typed. A generic parameter
accepts every kind of data. 'real', 'complex', 'scalar', 'matrix', 'boolean',
'function' and 'string' are all accepted by a generic-typed parameter.
'string' is a number of characters in single-quotes.
A 'boolean' only knows the two boolean-values true and false.
A 'function'-typed parameter accepts a functionreference (the @-operator applied
on a functionname).</P>

<P>The BMFUNC-directive declares a function specified by <CODE>funcsig</CODE> to be
built into Matlab. (look at 
<A HREF="#funcsig">funcsig</A>
for more information about specifying function-signatures).
A 'BMFUNC'-directive has two parts:
<OL>
<LI> the definition-part ('BMFUNC' funcsig)</LI>
<LI> the action-part ('DIFFTO' actionstring, IGNORE, ...)</LI>
</OL>

The first is used to define a function-signature and the second tells ADiMat
what to do if the function defined by <CODE>funcsig</CODE> is to be differentiated.
The possible actions are:
<DL>
<DT><B>'DIFFSTO'|'DIFFTO' actionstring </B><DD>
<P>The Matlab-expression
specified by the <CODE>actionstring</CODE> is inserted into the code where the
derivative of the function specified by <CODE>funcsig</CODE> is needed. Look at 
<A HREF="#actionstring">'actionstring'</A> for the specification of an
<CODE>actionstring</CODE>.</P>
<DT><B>'REPLACE'|'REPL' actionstring </B><DD>
<P>
<A NAME="replace"></A> 
The call to the function
specified by <CODE>funcsig</CODE> is deleted from the statement-list during
differentiation and substituted by the <CODE>actionstring</CODE>. For correct
program behaviour the <CODE>actionstring</CODE> has to contain a semantically
identical expression. That is, the original results have to contain the same
values as in the undifferentiated program. This action is used to make use of
functions, that compute additional information needed for the differentiation,
but that is not yet required by the code. A REPLACE action may consist of more
than one line of code, where a single \ at the end of a line acts as a
line-continuation marker. The REPLACE action is available since ADiMat version
0.5 and in the dbbuild tool only. I.e. it can not be used as a directive!</P>
<DT><B>'IGNORE'</B><DD>
<P>The function declared by <CODE>funcsig</CODE> is not
differentiated. It will occur in the differentiated code the same way like in
the undifferentiated code (e.g. 'BMFUNC $$=real($1) IGNORE'
corresponds to 'BMFUNC $$=real($1) DIFFTO real($1)').</P>
<DT><B>'NODIFF'</B><DD>
<P>The function declared by funcsig is not differentiable. When
trying to differentiated it, ADiMat will stop with an error. The function
declared by funcsig may be safely used in code-fragment that are not
differentiated.</P>
<DT><B>'ERROR' errormsg</B><DD>
<P>Similar behaviour like 'NODIFF', but
'errormsg' is printed instead. 'errormsg' is a doublequoted string that may
contain some special tokens:
<DL>
<DT><B>$n, $i</B><DD>
<P>the function-name,</P>
<DT><B>$f</B><DD>
<P>the filename,</P>
<DT><B>$p</B><DD>
<P>the pathname,</P>
<DT><B>$l</B><DD>
<P>the linenumber where the function occured,</P>
<DT><B>$c</B><DD>
<P>the character where the function occured.</P>
</DL>

These special-tokens are replaced at outputtime and may occur in any nummer and
order in the errorstring. The errormessage is written using printf, which
means that the control codes like '\n' and so on will act as usual.</P>
<DT><B>'WARING'|'WARN' warningmsg</B><DD>
<P>The message given by
<CODE>warningmsg</CODE> is printed during augmentation time and inserted into the
output source code as comment. A WARNING action may be added to every other
action including itself to issue the message given. A WARNING acition is added
to another action by specifying a builtin-declaration with exactly the same
<CODE>funcsig</CODE> and giving the WARNING message as action <B>before</B> the
builtin-declaration the WARNING message it to be added. It is
<B>not</B> possible to generally add a WARNING message to every occurrence of
a function by specifying a more general signature or the most general signature
<CODE>[$$#]= somefunc($#)</CODE>.
The <CODE>warningmsg</CODE> may contain the same $-tokens like the
<CODE>errormsg</CODE>.</P>
<DT><B>'SPEC' eol</B><DD>
<P>Is ignored currently. The spec-action is for future
enhancements of ADiMat. All builtin-declarations that use this action produce
a warning and are treated as if 'IGNORE' is specified instead. The line
is read until its end and the contents is discarded.</P>
