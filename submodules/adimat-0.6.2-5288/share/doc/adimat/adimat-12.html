<H2><A NAME="s12">12.</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc12">Dependecy graphs and further information</A></H2>

<P>ADiMat gathers information about the Matlab project analysed the user may
be interested in. This information may be added to the output files or written
to distinct files, which may be analysed using third party software.</P>
<H2><A NAME="calltree"></A> <A NAME="ss12.1">12.1</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc12.1">Calltree of functions</A>
</H2>

<P>The calltree shows dependencies between functions. The relation which function
is called by which and which function calls which is generated. This
information may be written to a file using different output-formats. The most
convenient is the 
<A HREF="adimat-19.html#vcg">vcg-format</A>. This graph description
language is parsed by a visualizer and may be browsed by the user. The
background color of an active function is changed to green. The visualizer may
be obtained using the url in the this bibliography-entry 
<A HREF="adimat-19.html#vcg">VCG</A>. The flag 
<A HREF="adimat-9.html#expctvcg">--exportctvcg</A> is used to
store the calltree in vcg-format.
Furthermore, one human readable format is available. The calltree is written
in simple ASCII. The file contains the list of all functions and the names
of the functions, that are called by this function. A function name 'f' may
occur more than once in the list functions called by a function 'g', which
indicates that the function 'f' is called more than once in the function body
of 'g'. Subfunctions local to a specific function are written like
being top-level functions. The output may be generated using the option
<A HREF="adimat-9.html#expcttxt">--exportcttxt</A>. This format is implemented only, if
no vcg-tool is availabe.
The last available output-format writes the calltree in a machine readable
format. All functions get a unique number and a list of callees and callers.
Both list enlist the numbers of the functions that are called by the current
function (the callees-list) and that call the current function. A single
number may occur more than once in a list, which shows that the function calls
or is called more than once by this function. The file may be generated using
the option 
<A HREF="adimat-9.html#expctsimp">--exportctsimp</A>.</P>
<H2><A NAME="vardeps"></A> <A NAME="ss12.2">12.2</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc12.2">Variable dependency graph</A>
</H2>

<P>ADiMat may write a file containing the dependencies between variables. A
variable 'u' depends on a variable 'v', if the variable 'v' occurs on the
right-hand side of an assignment to 'u'. The only available output-format is
the vcg-format. The dependencies are shown as a graph, where the variables are
the nodes and the dependencies are the edges. The edges are directed in the
way, that the tip points to the variable that is on the right-hand side of the
assignment. Each variable is displayed using a box. The variable-name is
prefixed using the scope-name in which the variable is defined or used. Global
variables are marked by using a rhombus instead of a box. The background color
of the boxes or rhombuses indicate the activation state of the variable. Four
states and therefore colors are possible. A white background indicates that
the variable is inactive, a green background that the variable is active, a
red background that the variable is reachable from an independent variable and
a yellow background denotes that the variable is reachable from an dependent
variable.
Use the option 
<A HREF="adimat-9.html#expdgvcg">--exportdgvcg</A> to get the file in
<A HREF="adimat-19.html#vcg">vcg-format</A>.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss12.3">12.3</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc12.3">Debugging information</A>
</H2>

<P>Two additional options exist, that enable the debuging of an ADiMat run. Both
deliver information about the binding of identifiers. The binding of an
identifier to a specific environment and scope is described.
The first option 
<A HREF="adimat-9.html#writescopefile">--writescopefile</A> generates
the file '&lt;OUTPUT_DIR&gt;/adimat.dbg'. The file contains a trace of the
process of identifying identifiers, called identifier-binding. The steps
needed to bind all identifiers are enlisted. In each step the scopes and their
environments are printed. Every function creates its own scope. Every scope
has three environments. One for identifiers that represent variable-names, one
for function-names and one environment that stores identifiers, whose use is
not yet encountered. In each environment the identifiers allready identified
are enlisted. Each identifier shows its occurences in the code and some
further information. The traces enables to comprehend the process and find
errors. This file is used identify errors during the development of ADiMat.
Tool-developers may have an interest in this file.
The second option 
<A HREF="adimat-9.html#envoutput">--envoutput</A> is hazardous in a
certain point of view. If the option is used, the written Matlab-files are
augmented with additional information for each identifier. After each
identifier in all Matlab-.m-files the information in which scope and
environment this specific identifier is bound. The file is no longer
understandable by Matlab. The information added by this flag has debugging
purpose only. The normal user does not need to bother about it.</P>
