<P>ADiMat uses command line options or directives within the parsed sources to
configure its behavior. In section 
<A HREF="adimat-8.html#usage">Usage</A>
options are described in greater detail.</P>
<H2><A NAME="adimat_directives"></A> <A NAME="ss10.1">10.1</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc10.1">adimat Directives</A>
</H2>

<P>Directives are Matlab-comments starting with the keyword 'ADiMat'. A directive
is used to manipulate the behaviour of ADiMat during its run. Nearly all
directives may appear anywhere in the code. The expections from this rule are
the directives starting with the prefix 'AD_'. They have to appear in the
first input file given to ADiMat. An occurrence in any additional file is not
forbidden, but does not make any sense.
Directives used to switch a specific feature on or off are named together,
seperating them using a commata. Some features of ADiMat may be selected
using a command line option or a directive. The directive overrides the
command line option in every case. The corresponding command line option is
named with its directive, respectively. The directives available are:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<DL>
<DT><B>AD_TOP=&lt;FUNCNAME&gt;</B><DD>
<P>The name of the function to differentiate. The function has to be called in
the current file using the variables defined as independent or dependent ones
using the AD_IVARS- and AD_DVARS-directives, respectively.</P>
<DT><B>AD_IVARS=&lt;IVARLIST&gt;</B><DD>
<P>Specifies the list of independent variables. The variables with which a
function is differentiated with respect to are called independent variables.
Multiple variables may be named here using a commata ',' to seperate them.</P>
<DT><B>AD_IVAR=&lt;IVAR&gt;</B><DD>
<P>A synonym for the above directive which can be used in the case of a
single variable being specified. ADiMat will also accept a list
though, it does not engange in english grammar checking.</P>
<DT><B>AD_INDEPENDENT=&lt;IVARLIST&gt;</B><DD>
<P>A synonym for the two above directives.</P>
<DT><B>AD_DVARS=&lt;DVARLIST&gt;</B><DD>
<P>Specifies the list of output variables of the top-level function for which
derivatives are sought. More than one variable may be named by seperating each
using a commata ','.</P>
<DT><B>AD_DVAR=&lt;DVAR&gt;</B><DD>
<P>A synonym for the above directive which can be used in the case of a
single variable being specified. ADiMat will also accept a list
though, it does not engange in english grammar checking.</P>
<DT><B>AD_DEPENDENT=&lt;DVARLIST&gt;</B><DD>
<P>A synonym for the two above directives.</P>
<DT><B>AD_OUTPUT_DIR="&lt;OUTPUTDIR&gt;"</B><DD>
<P>All files that are written by ADiMat will be created in the directory given by
&lt;OUTPUTDIR&gt;. Please note the double quotes around the &lt;OUTPUTDIR&gt;.
These are mandatory, because without them a slash within the directory would
be considered to be the division-operator. The directive is only usefull in
the first file of the current project to differentiate. It is optional, but
overrides the '-p' or '--outputdir' flag of the commandline.</P>
<DT><B>GLOBAL FORWARDMODE, GLOBAL FORWARD-MODE</B><DD>
<P>Select the forward mode of automatic differentiation. Currently this flag has
a global scope, that is, specifying it anywhere will switch the mode of
differentitation of the current project to forward mode. Until now no
alternative modes are implemented, the directive may be obmitted therefore.
But it is considered good style to specify it, if a project is to be
differentiated using forward mode anytime. The command line switches overriden
by this directive are: '-f', '--forward-mode', '-r', '--reverse-mode', '-m'
and '--hybrid-mode'.</P>
<DT><B>GLOBAL REVERSEMODE, GLOBAL REVERSE-MODE</B><DD>
<P>This directive is non-functional currently. The reverse mode of automatic
differentiation is not implemented yet. Specifying this flag, yields a
warning, but ADiMat continues to differentiate the current project using the
forward mode.The command line switches overriden by this directive are: '-f',
'--forward-mode', '-r', '--reverse-mode', '-m' and '--hybrid-mode'.</P>
<DT><B>GLOBAL HYBRIDMODE, GLOBAL HYBRID-MODE</B><DD>
<P>Same like reverse mode. Not implemented yet. Specifying it, results in a
warning. The command line switches overriden by this directive are: '-f',
'--forward-mode', '-r', '--reverse-mode', '-m' and '--hybrid-mode'.</P>
<DT><B>GLOBAL NOFORWARDVARRESOLVE, GLOBAL FORWARDVARRESOLVE</B><DD>
<P>This directive is implemented for highly sophisticated code (also called
<I>bad style code</I>). In Matlab it is possible to use an identifier as a
function and
later on to denote a variable. This is considered bad style, but supported by
ADiMat. The standard behaviour of ADiMat is to look forward in the parsed code
to find a defining occurrence of an identifier (that is, a left-hand side
occurrence of a variable). That is, in the example 'b=a; a=3;' ADiMat will
treat the first 'a' like the second one, allthough 'a' was not defined before
first use. A warning will be issued. Note, it may not be an error that a
variable occurs in a using context before it is defined, think about an
'if then else'- construct, where the variable is defined in the else part
and used only in the then part. For common codes the directive
'GLOBAL FORWARDVARRESOLVE' is suitable, which is the default. If a code
fails to be parsed, because of problems during the identification of the
identifiers, try this directive. This directive overrides the command line
option '--noforwardvarresolve'.</P>
<DT><B>GLOBAL WRITESCOPEFILE</B><DD>
<P>Write the file '&lt;OUTPUTDIR&gt;/adimat.dbg' which contains debuging
information about the binding of identifiers. This directive is for debugging
use only.</P>
<DT><B>GLOBAL NOBUILTINS</B><DD>
<P>Switch off the builtin system. This is no good idea! Specifying this option
hinders ADiMat's use of derivative information stored in the database. None
of
the hunderts of builtin Matlab-functions will get differentiated, nor is it
possible to specify 
<A HREF="adimat-14.html#BMFUNC">BMFUNC ...</A> directives.</P>
<DT><B>GLOBAL NOLOCALMFILES, GLOBAL LOCALMFILES</B><DD>
<P>Matlab allows two sorts of files. Files containing a function and files
containing statements only. The former kind is not affected by this directive,
but the later. A statement file (called m-file here) causes a problem, when
called from more than one function. Different sets of variables may be active.
If the directive 'LOCALMFILES' is used, which is the default, each m-file will
be duplicated each time it is called from a function and the name of the
calling function is concatenated to the m-file name. This localises the m-file
and enables correct identification of the identifiers within the file. This
techinque is in alpha-state and therefore not applicable every time. If ADiMat
complains about missing identifiers and the project contains an m-file, then
the directive 'GLOBAL NOLOCALMFILES' may solve the problem. This directive
overrides the command line option '--nolocalmfiles'.</P>
<DT><B>GLOBAL ENVOUTPUT</B><DD>
<P>Each identifier in the whole program is augmented with information of its
state within ADiMat. The output-files produced by ADiMat are no longer valid
Matlab-files. The directive is for debuging purpose only.</P>
<DT><B>GLOBAL NOOPEROPTIM, GLOBAL OPEROPTIM</B><DD>
<P>These directives disable/ enable the use of an optimisation, if a binary
operator is used more than once successively to compute a derivative. Assume
the expression a* b* c is to be differentiated with respect to all three
variables. If the flag NOOPEROPTIM is set, then the derivative looks like
this: g_a* b* c+ a* g_b* c+ a* b *g_c. This code is not very efficient,
because each multiplication of a derivative object g_? with any over object
executes a loop for each operator. That is, for the example above 7 loops are
executed (the product of a* b contains no derivative object and no loop
therefore). Using the flag OPEROPTIM the above derivative expression will be
replaced with a function call and the number of loops executed will be
decreased significantly (currently five loops are executed, but in future
versions only one loop may be executed). The default is to use OPEROPTIM, the
ability to switch of the optimization of operator differentiation is merely a
tool for performance-meassurement. This directive overrides the command line
option '--nooperoptim'.</P>
<DT><B>GLOBAL NOLOCALCSE, GLOBAL LOCALCSE</B><DD>
<P>
<A NAME="globalnolocalcse"></A> 
Dis-/Enables local common subexpression elimination (cse). The transformation
is applied to all files if this statement is encountered anywhere. During the
canonicalisation step ADiMat may encounter that one subexpression is evaluated
several times. The code is transformed in a way that the subexpression is
evaluated only once and stored in a temporary variable. The temporary variable
is inserted into the code where a reevaluation of the subexpression would have
occurred. This directive switches off/on the optimization strategy. This may
be needed, if one of the subexpressions contained a function with sideeffects.
This directive implies setting the 
<A HREF="#globalnoglobalcse">GLOBAL NOGLOBALCSE</A> directive. The directive overrides '--nolocalcse',
'--localcse' and partially '--globalcse'. The latter one is only partially
overriden, because switching off local cse switches off global cse, too.</P>
<DT><B>GLOBAL NOGLOBALCSE, GLOBAL GLOBALCSE</B><DD>
<P>
<A NAME="globalnoglobalcse"></A> 
Switches off/on global common subexpression elimination. ADiMat applies a
common subexpression elimination algorithm to the whole code after the
canonicalization step. This directive may be of use, if the code contains
functions with side effects. The resulting code may be incorrect. Try this
directive or the commandline option 
<A HREF="adimat-9.html#noglobalcse">--noglobalcse</A> to check if the cse caused the problem. This directive
overrides '--noglobalcse', '--globalcse' and partially '--localcse'. The latter
one is overriden partially, because global cse needs local cse.</P>
<DT><B>GLOBAL NOLOOPSAVING, GLOBAL LOOPSAVING</B><DD>
<P>Disables/Enables optimized operators in derivative computations. During
computation of derivatives loops iterate over the number of derivatives. In
the derivative of a product three loops are run. The loopsaving operator, in
fact a function, combines these three loops to one single loop minimizing the
computational effort. It is highly recommended to use loopsaving
operators/functions. The loopsaving functions are denote by the 'ls_'-prefix.
This directive overrides the '--noloopsaving' flag.</P>
<DT><B>GLOBAL NOOVERWRITINGCHECK, GLOBAL OVERWRITINGCHECK</B><DD>
<P>Disable/Enable the check for variable updates. A variable update is an
assignment to a variable <CODE>v</CODE> where the variable occurs on the right- and
left-hand side of the assignment. In fact, it is not only checked if an update
occured, but it is also prevented that the variable <CODE>v</CODE> is overwritten in
the same assignment it is used in. The motivation for this check is simply the
fact, that within the derivative expression of the assignment, the original
value of <CODE>v</CODE> before the update may be needed. This directive overrides the
option '--nooverwrtchk'.</P>
<DT><B>GLOBAL SECONDORDERFWD, GLOBAL SECONDORDERFWDMD</B><DD>
<P>Compute Hessians along with the gradients. This directive switches on the
computation of second-order derivatives. </P>

<DT><B>GLOBAL PARENTCHECK, GLOBAL CANON_PARENTCHECK, GLOBAL POST_PARENTCHECK</B><DD>
<P>Check consistency of the AST. This is a debugging directive. See 
<A HREF="adimat-9.html#parentcheck">--parentcheck</A> for more information.</P>
<DT><B>GLOBAL NOSCALARFOLDING, GLOBAL SCALARFOLDING, GLOBAL NOPRESCALARFOLDING,
GLOBAL PRESCALARFOLDING, GLOBAL NOPOSTSCALARFOLDING, GLOBAL POSTSCALARFOLDING</B><DD>
<P>Disable/Enable folding of constant real scalar expressions at transformation
time. Have a look at the commandline option for more information (see 
<A HREF="adimat-9.html#noscalarfolding">--noscalarfolding</A>). These directives override:
'--noscalarfolding', '--noprescalarfolding', and '--nopostscalarfolding'.</P>
<DT><B>GLOBAL NOCONSTFOLDMULT0, GLOBAL CONSTFOLDMULT0</B><DD>
<P>If 
<A HREF="adimat-9.html#noscalarfolding">scalarfolding</A> is enabled, then this
directive can be used to switch off and on the folding of products whose one
factor is zero. This directive overrides: '--noconstfoldmult0'.</P>
<DT><B>GLOBAL NONARGINMAPPER, GLOBAL NARGINMAPPER</B><DD>
<P>Omit/permit creation of nargin mappers for functions using the Matlab
function nargin. See command line option 
<A HREF="adimat-9.html#nonargmapper">nonargmapper</A> for more information. This option allows a finer control
over the created mappers, by permitting creation for nargin only.</P>
<DT><B>GLOBAL NONARGOUTMAPPER, GLOBAL NARGOUTMAPPER</B><DD>
<P>Omit/permit creation of nargout mappers for functions using the Matlab
function nargout. See command line option 
<A HREF="adimat-9.html#nonargmapper">nonargmapper</A> for more information. This option allows a finer control
over the created mappers, by permitting creation for nargout only.</P>
<DT><B>GLOBAL NOTMPCLEAR, GLOBAL TMPCLEAR</B><DD>
<P>Omit/Insert statements for clearing temporary variables inserted by ADiMat. See
command line option 
<A HREF="adimat-9.html#notmpclear">--notmpclear</A> for more
information.</P>
<DT><B>GLOBAL NOVISITFWDMD, GLOBAL VISITFWDMD</B><DD>
<P>Use the old way of computing forward mode derivatives. Beware the old way is
not capable of treating all Matlab constructs correctly. It is strongly advised
not to use these options. The associated command line switch is 
<A HREF="adimat-9.html#visitfwdmd">--visitfwdmd</A>.</P>
<DT><B>GLOBAL NOZEROPOWZEROCHECK, GLOBAL ZEROPOWZEROCHECK</B><DD>
<P>Omit/permit creation of code for computing the correct derivative for 0^0
statements. See 
<A HREF="adimat-9.html#nozeropowzerocheck">--no0pow0check</A> for more
information.</P>
<DT><B>GLOBAL NOSIGNATUREENSURE, GLOBAL SIGNATUREENSURE</B><DD>
<P>Prevent/Force ADiMat from/to insert dummy objects for function's
parameter/result lists that are incompatibly called from more than two functions
and where the transitive closure recommends a certain signature. See 
<A HREF="adimat-9.html#nosigensure">--nosigensure</A> for more information.</P>
<DT><B>BMFUNC ..., BJFUNC ..., BCFUNC ..., BCOMMAND ..., BVAR ...</B><DD>
<P>
<A NAME="directivebuiltindeclaration"></A> 
The builtin-declarations may be used like a directive, too. For their
description look at the chapter 
<A HREF="adimat-14.html#builtins">builtins</A>.
<A NAME="FUNCTION_HANDLE"></A> </P>
<DT><B>FUNCTION_HANDLE=&lt;VARLIST&gt;</B><DD>
<P>Specifies a list of variables that have class function_handle in the
current scope. ADiMat needs this declaration to distinguish between
array indexing and calls of function handles, as both are
syntactically equal. ADiMat will treat the calls to declared function
handles similarly as calls to user defined functions. This means that
for any function handle foo, function handles g_foo (FM), rec_foo, and
ret_foo (RM) must also be available. If a function parameter is
declared to be of type function_handle, ADiMat will automatically
augment the signature to contain these names as well.
Consider the function signature
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
function r = someFunc(a,b,f_ptr)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Inside the function body the directive FUNCTION_HANDLE must be used:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
%ADiMat FUNCTION_HANDLE=f_ptr
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If all parameters are active, in FM the signature will be augmented as
follows
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
function [g_r, r] = g_someFunc(g_a,a, g_b,b, g_f_ptr,f_ptr)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

In a driver routine, g_someFunc should be called something like that
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[g_a g_b] = createFullGradients(a,b);
[g_r r] = g_someFunc(g_a,a, g_b,b, @g_otherFunc,@otherFunc)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

In RM the signature will be augmented as follows
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
function [a_a, a_b, nr_r] = a_someFunc(a,b,f_ptr,rec_ptr,ret_ptr)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

In a driver routine, a_someFunc should be called something like that
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
r = someFunc(a,b,@otherFunc)
[a_r] = createFullGradients(r);
[a_a a_b r] = a_someFunc(a, b, @otherFunc, @rec_otherFunc, @ret_otherFunc)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The top level derivative functions must by called with additional
arguments representing function handles to the differentiated versions
of function otherfunc. The function otherfunc should be differentiated
with ADiMat in a separate step.
There are some limitations of this directive:
<UL>
<LI>Function handles must be declared separately in each function
where they occur in.</LI>
<LI>The function the handle refers to will not be differentiated
automatically.</LI>
<LI>All arguments of calls to functions handles will be
differentiated.</LI>
<LI>The activity analysis can usually detect whether a function
handle variable is active and will not differentiate it if that is not
necessary. However, when a function handle is not used inside a
function f, but only passed on to a subfunction g, then it may be
necessary to declare the function handle variable as active using
AD_ACTIVE=f_ptr to produce the correct calls to g and the augmented
signature in f.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<DT><B>AD_ACTIVE=&lt;VARLIST&gt;</B><DD>
<P>Specifies a list of variables that ADiMat should treat as being active
in the current scope (i.e. where the directive occures). Normally any
variable on a path from a independent to a dependent variable is
active and this will be detected by ADiMat's activiy analysis. This
directive only serves as an escape hatch should that fail somehow. There
are currently two possible scenarios where this directive is useful:
<UL>
<LI>Handling function handles that are not called in a certain
function but passed on as arguments to subfunction calls.</LI>
<LI>Forcing ADiMat to produce derivative parameters for
some parameters that are not active. This can be used to force ADiMat to
produce a certain function signature.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
</DL>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The next few lines show an example using the most commonly used directives
within the file given to ADiMat at the command line.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
% First the mandatory data
%ADiMat AD_DVARS= z
%ADiMat AD_IVARS= b
%ADiMat AD_TOP= f
% This is optional
%ADiMat AD_OUTPUT_DIR="ad_out/"
b=0.1:0.1:100;
z=f(b);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

NOTE! Each ADiMat-directive within a Matlab file has to be preceeded by
the string '%ADiMat ' exactly as written here. No space after the percent-sign
is allowed nor different combinations of upper- and lowercase letters in the
word ADiMat are allowed. Using this strict rule a directive may be switched of
by simply altering the case of one letter or inserting a space after the
percent-sign.</P>

<H2><A NAME="admrev_directives"></A> <A NAME="ss10.2">10.2</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc10.2">admproc Directives</A>
</H2>

<P>As with adimat, admrev directives are Matlab-comments starting with the keyword 'ADiMat'. The
remainder of the line must be a well-formed XML subtree, however.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
function foo = bar(x,y,z)
%
%ADiMat &lt;nargin>3&lt;/nargin>
  foo = x*y+z;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

There are not many directives yet.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<DL>
<DT><B>&lt;parallel/&gt;</B><DD>
<P>Declare that the for loop in which the directive occurs is
parallelizable. This is the case if the order of execution of the loop
body does not matter.
The loop iterations in the forward sweep will not be recorded, instead
the loop is differentiated by performing little forward and return
sweeps on the loop body during the function's return sweep.</P>
<DT><B>&lt;nargin&gt;number&lt;/nargin&gt;</B><DD>
<P>Declare that the function in which the directive occurs will always
be called with at least number arguments. This helps ADiMat to decide
which of the functions arguments are to be saved for the return sweep.</P>
<DT><B>&lt;recompute&gt;name&lt;/recompute&gt;</B><DD>
<P>
<A NAME="recompute"></A> 
Declare that the call(s) to function name in the following statement
is to be recomputed in the reverse sweep. This has the effect that
function name is called in the storage sweep and function a_name in
the reverse sweep. The normal strategy is to save the computattions of
the storage sweep, calling rec_name in the storage and ret_name in the
reverse sweep.</P>
